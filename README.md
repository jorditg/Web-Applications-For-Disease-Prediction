# Web Applications for Disease Prediction

This repository contains sample web applications for the prediction of diseases using machine learning models. Specifically, it includes applications for:

1. Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using fundus images.
2. Skin Melanoma Prediction using images of skin lesions.
3. Other related projects

Each application consists of a backend that runs on a server and a frontend that is web-based.

## Diabetic Retinopathy Classification

The Diabetic Retinopathy Classification application is designed to predict diabetic retinopathy using fundus images of the eye. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of fundus images labeled for diabetic retinopathy severity.

### Features:

- Upload fundus images for prediction.
- Visualize predicted diabetic retinopathy severity.
- User-friendly web interface.

## Skin Melanoma Prediction

The Skin Melanoma Prediction application predicts the presence of melanoma in skin lesions based on input images. It employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset of skin lesion images labeled for melanoma.

### Features:

- Upload images of skin lesions for prediction.
- Receive predictions for the presence of melanoma.
- Intuitive web interface for ease of use.
